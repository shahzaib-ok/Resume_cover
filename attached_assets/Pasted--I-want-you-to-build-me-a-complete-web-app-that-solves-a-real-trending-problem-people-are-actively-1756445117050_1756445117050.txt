
I want you to build me a complete web app that solves a real, trending problem people are actively searching for online. The app should:

1. **App Idea (choose and build one of these – whichever you can best implement):**

   * **AI Resume & Cover Letter Generator** → People are constantly searching for free tools to generate ATS-friendly resumes and cover letters.
   * **Free PDF Tools (Merge, Split, Compress, Convert to Word/Excel/Images)** → Very high search demand, evergreen, and easy to monetize.
   * **AI-Powered YouTube Title & Thumbnail Idea Generator** → Content creators search for free tools to improve their video performance.
   * **Language Practice Chatbot (with daily challenges)** → Students and learners search for free practice apps.

   Pick one of these (or combine if simple enough) and create the full SaaS-like website.

2. **Tech Stack Requirements:**

   * Build using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React preferred)** so it can be deployed anywhere and embedded in **Google Sites**.
   * Must be **responsive** and optimized for both desktop and mobile.
   * Add clean UI with TailwindCSS (if possible).

3. **Features to Include:**

   * A simple **login/signup system** (optional: just local storage or Firebase if easier).
   * A free tier of the tool (no payments needed right now).
   * Export/Download/Copy functionality for generated content (e.g., download PDF, copy resume text, copy video titles, etc.).
   * SEO-friendly structure so that it ranks on Google.

4. **Monetization (Google AdSense Ready):**

   * Add a clear **sidebar or banner ad placement** area where Google Ads can later be inserted.
   * Place 2–3 ad placeholders on pages in **non-intrusive** spots (e.g., sidebar, header, or between content).

5. **Deployment:**

   * Provide the **full code** with clear instructions.
   * The final output should be embeddable in **Google Sites** via `<iframe>` or direct upload.

6. **UI/UX Guidelines:**

   * Use a **modern, minimal, SaaS-style design**.
   * Add a **landing page** with a hero section that explains the tool in 1–2 sentences.
   * Add a **features section** and a **call-to-action** button to use the tool.

7. **Extra Details:**

   * Ensure the code is modular and easy to expand.
   * No backend server required unless absolutely necessary (prefer client-side).
   * If backend is needed, use free-tier Firebase or Node.js.

**Final Deliverable:**
A complete website app (resume builder, PDF tool, AI YouTube helper, or language practice chatbot) that is ready to embed into Google Sites, structured for SEO, and has Google AdSense-ready ad placements.
